So they decided to bring in some new heat to spice things upp: Bereinger and Aruvia, ranked number 2 and 3 respectively on a global popularity scale. Fans are aching with curiosity, wondering how these two fan favorites are gonna fair against the ruthless Dionne.",

Pok√©mon are real, and her life is a mirror image of her own, with one horrifying difference: her mother and sister are gone, her father is a ghost of a man, and she has a dark history of her own.

With a killer on the loose and people to protect, she must find a way to survive in a world that is not her own, in a much younger body than she knew.\n\nThe development of this world, and the lives of the people close to her rest on her ability to confront the past and save a future that she never knew.",

His life in Manila is as average as it gets, wake up to the sound of honking jeepneys, scroll through endless emails, endure the daily train squeeze, order overpriced coffee, and wonder if he should finally start working out.\n\nExcept, once a month, he transforms into a wolf.\n\nHonestly? It‚Äôs not as bad as it sounds. The first few times were painful, sure, but he learned to manage. He preps for it like someone meal-prepping for the week, lock the doors, stock up on food, and let the wolf do its thing.

No skyscrapers. No Wi-Fi. No explanation. Just majestic waterfalls, warring tribes, and a whole lot of sharks. And if that wasn‚Äôt bad enough? The transmigration removed his lycanthropy.\n\nWill he get it back? Does he even want to?\n\nJoin Evan as he navigates the untamed rivers, snakes and crocodiles lurking everywhere, and curtailing his shame at wiping his ass with a stone.\n\nOh, and did I mention we might have flying-torso monsters? Maybe.",

Yet one still dares to seek the forbidden mystic knowledge of the past.\n\nThreading a road none have walked for centuries is one few could endure, but Ahrden refuses to bow to the world‚Äôs silence. His pursuit of the arcane‚Äîmisunderstood by all‚Äîstirs fear among his people and incurs their wrath, earning him exile.

He made a vow to never fall in love again after things with the ghost and the criminal ended so horribly. This doesn't stop him from making new friends, especially another quiet, troubled, bullied, young man named Remington. Vezaias tries desperately not to fall in love with him but fate seems to draw them closer without any effort. Things go south when Remington is bullied by kids at school but worse yet he is bullied by his own father for being friends with Vezaias. This prompts Vezaias to distance himself from Remington in an attempt to lessen the ridicule and torture. Vezaias plays it safe by getting a girlfriend and cements himself into a relationship where he isn't satisfied at all being the perfect boyfriend to the perfect girl. Remington's father catches him trying to admit his feelings for Vezaias, and suddenly even being just friends is dangerous. Keeping their friendship a secret for such a long time destroys both of their happiness and suddenly Vezaias is ready to admit loud and clear how much he loves Remington but that only brings upon a tragedy so horrible that Remington decides to ghost Vezaias for good. Will they ever be together? Or will Vezaias be cursed to wander the streets alone forever? Or will Vezaias or Remington decide that life just isn't worth living anymore?",

Instead of ascension, he was met with oblivion. He awakens in a broken, unfamiliar body, within the filthy confines of an underground clinic, his divine core replaced by a crude, pulsating mechanical device sutured into his chest.\n\nThis new world is a cyberpunk dystopia. Megacorporations reign supreme, controlling everything from the very air people breathe to the Dimensional Portals that spew monsters and priceless resources. Power is defined by a rigid Ranking System, and the body Lin Wei now inhabits belonged to Kai ‚Äî a Null, a wretched youth born without a spark of mana, the most despised refuse of a society built on supernatural strength.\n\nWeak, disoriented, and with only a few hours left to live, Lin Wei discovers that the device in his chest is his sole key to survival. It is more than a core emulator; it is a weapon that allows him to drain energy and access forbidden protocols, making him a ghost in the system ‚Äî invisible to the cosmic Constellations that sponsor other hunters and an unpredictable anomaly to the corporations that rule this world.\n\nTo reclaim his power and uncover the conspiracy that cast him into this abyss, the fallen emperor must learn to survive in the shadowy underworld of Neo-Angeles. He must fight, steal, and hunt within the city‚Äôs most dangerous dungeons, wielding his ancestral cunning and the heretical technology carved into his flesh to hack the very system built to oppress him.\n\nHis journey is not to become a hero. It is to prove that a god cast down into the body of a rat is still a god. And that even trash can ignite ‚Äî and burn an empire to ashes.",

Thank you.)\n\nFor those that love Cozy Fantasy.\n\nRosalina doesn't live a normal life. Okay-technically she does. She works, eats, sleeps... But when she dreams, she enters another world; one where she's tasked with keeping innocent people safe from Nightmares.\n\nThen there's Henry. Artist. Brooding. Moody. You know the type. He thinks he's charming. He's not. Worst of all, ¬†he's a Dreamer-In-Training, and Rosalina is his trainer.\n\nRosalina doesn't want to deal with Henry's brand of stubborn; not when her own life is quietly falling apart. But fate, dreams, and work keep pulling them together.\n\nIt's too many responsibilities, too many secrets, and just maybe... too many feelings.",

We excelled at everything: warfare and romance, mass destruction and boundless creativity, cruelty and kindness.\n\nFrom the ashes of Earth a new generation of legends were born. The Lady of the Wilds. The Endless Storm. Legion. The Eternal Dreamer. Karen. Bob. The Sun Reborn. He Who Screams into the Abyss and Stares into the Void (trust me, he's exactly as insufferable as he sounds). Bruno‚Ä¶whom we've collectively agreed not to discuss. The list goes on.\n\nThese legends reshaped reality and carved their names across the stars.I'm not one of them. I've stood beside them, bled with them, even changed some of their diapers. But you won't find me in the historical records, except perhaps as \"unnamed associate\" on page 394. That suits me fine.\n\nWhen everything went to hell, I didn't discover any ancient bloodlines or awaken primal powers. I was just your average late 30s recovering-from-burn-out millennial dad doing his best, who suddenly had to figure out how to gentle parent his way through the apocalypse with his 6 year old girl and her army of imaginary friends.\n\nI never aspired to heroism, yet heroes surround me. I only wanted to be a decent father, loving husband, occasional maker of interesting things, sometimes fisherman, and amateur delver-of-forgotten-places. You know - normal System Apocalypse stuff.\n\nNote from Author: If you're looking for a story about a OP MC who is a genius of his era - this isn't it.¬† This is the story of your average guy, doing his best in an impossible situation.¬† Will there be adventure? Yes.¬† Action? Assuredly.¬† Danger? Indubitably.¬† Trying to reason with a 6 year old? 100%.¬† Woke leftist overtones? Without a doubt.¬† Harems? Not a chance in¬† H E double hockey sticks.\n\nCover art generated using Midjourney.",

Each carries a story of loss, defiance, or strange awakening: a fire that refuses to die, a storm that bends but never breaks, a voice that cuts through silence, a shadow that learns to walk in the light. Their paths are different, but all lead to the same threshold.\n\nThese are the beginnings of the NeXt Generation‚Äîtheir choices, their scars, their first steps into recursion. Before the battles, before the betrayals, before their names become legend, this is how they became Technomancers.\n\nPerfect for fans of cyberpunk epics, found family, and myth woven through machinery, Heirs of the NeXt is part of the wider Technomancers Rise saga‚Äîavailable now on Amazon.",

In the shadows beneath their crumbling family estate, he invokes forbidden rites ‚Äî binding her soul to a crystal and dragging her back into a half-life of rage, beauty, and unnatural endurance.\n\nBut resurrection comes at a price. Alaric must feed the crystal with human souls, each death staining his hands and pushing him further into madness.

His search for the killer brings him into dangerous proximity with a veiled young woman who hides more than her face behind her shawl. Drawn to her spirit but unaware of her true nature, Jonathan soon finds his pursuit of justice entwined with the darkest secrets of the Ashcroft family.\n\nIn the fog-choked streets of Thalia, where gaslight falters and shadows whisper, love and death walk hand in hand.",

One fateful day, while reading his favorite game turned comic series, Princess Adventures(as hilarious as it sounds), he is teleported to the world of the series. He awakes, and finds that he has been chosen by the Crown of The Sword Princess, a legendary princess who altered history. He quickly finds that he was teleported into the unfiltered, and non-family friendly version of the series, a world where his newfound paper could very well be his end. His crown throws him into the midst of¬† a struggle between multiple kingdoms, making it even harder to survive. Can Arthur mature as a person, mature in his power, and find a way back home with the help of his newfound allies?\n\nExcuse the cover art, I'm currently making a new one. In this story you will see overworld maps like this:¬†¬†üå≥‚óè‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚óè‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚óèüè∞\n\nThey are more detailed in the later arcs/chapters, but they will change based on the progress of an arc. They will be kept ambiguous in some parts to keep tension, that sort of stuff.\n\nThis is a story with tone shifts, action shits. It will be fast paced or slow paced given the arc. Please be patient with my upload schedule, I'm aiming for at least 3 uploads a week, but eventually plan to upload daily when I have the time/am able to. I have made the basics for maps for each arc, the mostly finished one being the first kingdom. With this all being said, enjoy the start of this series I plan to be doing for a decent while!",

On the battlefront slumber was delicacy, thundering noise of forged iron clashing, and crimson blood flowing relentless like a tidal wave.\n\nBut all of it came to an end in one swift year, no one knew where they came from, no one knew their identities, they were ghosts among the dead on the floor and barbed wire.\n\nWhen the war ended, no one found them again, and the head of that pack was presumed killed in action 2 months before the battles finalized.\n\nNow it's the beginning of 2026, In Japan this year was opened not just with deafening applause and glorious triumph, but with the prayers and wishes of sinners sitting at shrines for blessings in the future.\n\nHe will not allow that to happen.",

Convinced he's been given a chance at a simple, peaceful life, he spends the next two decades living as a hermit.

Unbeknownst to him, the world he lives in is a dangerous, fantastical one governed by the laws of cultivation.\n\nHe writes a novel about a grand and intricate cultivation world, blissfully unaware that everything he creates is subtly influencing the world around him. His \"writing tools\" are powerful artifacts, his \"crop farming\" is cultivating magical herbs, and the \"fantasy\" he writes is actually a detailed prophecy that is being misinterpreted by powerful cultivators.\n\nThe \"misunderstanding\" is not just his; the entire cultivation world is misunderstanding his every move, viewing him as a legendary, reclusive grandmaster who is playing a long, dangerous game. He believes he is a normal person living a peaceful life, but a dangerous storm of powerful cultivators is gathering at his doorstep, all seeking the \"mysteries\" of the legendary cultivator who just wants to be left alone.",

Her path is one of contradictions ‚Äî fragile yet unyielding, human yet not wholly so, sheltered yet constantly tested.\n\nAcross moments of wonder and beauty lie undercurrents of loneliness, expectation, and secrets too heavy for a child to carry. The voices of family, mentors, and unseen watchers weave through her journey as she struggles to answer the questions that will define her existence: What am I? Who am I meant to become?\n\nThis is not the beginning of Lorelei‚Äôs true tale, but the roots beneath it.

An alien refugee ship crash landed in the Himalayas, and in it a living virus of sentient, mutagenic monsters spilled forth. Technology began to fail, and the armies of the world found themselves in a desperate battle for survival. Hatching a desperate plan using the alien ship's own implacable technology, mankind launched the Arks, massive mobile city-factories enveloped in a time dilation bubble and packed with the remnants of the Old World, to be re-awoken in the future. But something went wrong, and now what should have been a blip of a few thousand years has become a few million, and the remnants of mankind must face a new, savage land of mystery, monsters and magic, as the world they once knew lie dead and buried beneath the sands of time.",

He was overlooked by his peers - and only shown pity and scorn by the powerful. But when he's sent to the otherworld and awaken the power to create runes and bind it with paper magic, he seizes the chance to break free and heal his mother of her cancer.\n\nWith the power to craft his wildest dreams into reality, Kim begins his arduous rise from the bottom. But even with the aid of an immensely powerful mage as a mentor, the path to the summit is riddled with peril. He quickly begins to realize that his power has limits. Each complex rune formation eats away at his soul. On Earth, forming runes is impossibly difficult. And the more journeys he takes to the otherworld, the harder it is to get out.\n\nFinally, when the gods realize he's unknowingly stolen an ancient treasure from their vaults, they'll stop at nothing to crush him.\n\nWhat to expect:-Weak to strong male MC-Daily releases-Fast paced with frequent powerups-Portal world inspired by Solo Leveling, as well as a fantasy otherworld to explore-Cultivation elements (mana cores, tiers, extending lifespan)-Morally grey MC-Paper (duh)-Runecrafting (duh)-Dragon and other paper beasts\n\nAvg chapter length: 2k words",

He stages his paintings in alleys, markets, and crossings, chasing \"proof\" that presence itself can be art. His work is defaced, ignored, priced by others, claimed as free, yet he persists‚Äîadjusting rather than beginning again. A drifter in a fish coat becomes his closest witness, offering quiet challenges about ownership and meaning. When a beggar asks for food and water, the artist, protective of his piece and the fragile order around it, slashes the man‚Äôs throat with a mirror shard. He reframes the corpse as part of the canvas, documenting the scene like evidence. Convinced the act completes the work, he offers himself as suspect, but the police dismiss him. Left with only his notebook, the ruined painting, and the gaze of a cat that never reacts, he accepts the murder and its aftermath as his final artwork‚Äîthe proof he sought, earned by stillness no one else needs to validate.",

After all, what could go wrong in a world home to Cinderella and Little Red Riding Hood?\n\nEverything.\n\nThis is a world where fairy tales are nightmares. A realm where dawn and dusk were stolen, time is fractured, and monsters from other dimensions stir in the deep woods. Here, the gods are dead and the sky itself is shattering.\n\nTo gain power, Dawn must die. But with each revival chipping away at his body and his soul, will he lose himself completely before he even learns the rules of this twisted game?\n\n...\n\nThis story is my take on the world's most famous fairy tales, but with a few twists. It features:\n\n-A protagonist trying to survive in an incredibly dangerous world.\n\n-Lots of action, mystery, and a main character who will be facing death very often.\n\n-Gender bender as a core plot element.\n\n-And even some slice-of-life and harem moments to cool down.\n\nMy release schedule will be 1 chapter every 1-2 days.

White hair? Cool. Blue eyes? Meh. A body that can use mana? Cliche. Sounds like an upgrade‚Äîexcept life still refuses to be easy.Kibo is smart, a quick learner, and genuinely lovable. He treasures his family, makes dumb mistakes, and somehow stumbles his way into becoming stronger. But when it comes to fighting? This dude is straight-up insane‚Äîbleeding, bruised, smiling like he just found a cheat code. Losing? Sometimes. He might not be the strongest at first, but he‚Äôs got two things going for him: pure stubbornness and an annoying voice in his head named Ignis.But hey, life isn‚Äôt all epic battles and badass moments. Kibo is still human, still figuring things out, and still scared of losing the people who actually care about him. And yeah, sometimes the weight of it all almost breaks him. Almost.But Kibo isn‚Äôt going down without a fight. If fate wants to mess with him, it better be ready for the fight of his entire life.A story about love, loss, and one reincarnated lunatic who refuses to stay down.Note:- ¬†If you want to find more chapters of this story, it's located on Webnovel. As an assistant to the author, I'm directing you to Webnovel for additional chapters.",

    "description": "A month after arriving in Pyrethorne, capital of the Cindral Empire, Ash works behind the anvil of the Black Forge, a smithy that is far more than it seems. By day he sells steel at prices that bleed the guilds dry. By night, he bends the alleys to his will. To his apprentices, he is a master. To thieves, he is law. To the poor, he is hope. To the nobles, he is a threat. They call him the Ash Prince.\n\nThe legend begins in whispers when Ash humiliates rival gangs who try to extort him, proving the Black Forge is more than a smith‚Äôs shop. In the markets, he undercuts guild smiths and feeds spies false trails, turning rumor into a weapon sharper than any blade. When nobles hire gangs to burn him out, Ash rallies his apprentices and thieves, defeating them and reforging their weapons into tokens of loyalty ‚Äî the first Ash-Marks.\n\nBut the nobles do not stop. Assassins strike from the shadows, only to find Ash waiting. His duel spreads fear across the alleys: the Ash Prince cannot be killed. Then comes the Festival of Masks, where the city blazes with lanterns and fire. Ash uses the chaos to rob nobles, plant false evidence, and even brush unknowingly against his bloodline ‚Äî Daerion or Lyraea, his siblings, who sense a strange recognition. The Empress herself glimpses him across the crowd, shaken by the sight.\n\nWhen riots erupt in the Charred Ring, Ash arms his guild and directs the defense of the streets. His strategy not only saves his people but also shields Imperial troops. By dawn, the alleys openly chant his name. The Black Forge has become a fortress. The people have crowned their outlaw.\n\nIn the heart of Pyrethorne, one truth burns brighter than the festival‚Äôs embers:\n\nThe Ash Prince has risen",

For years he kept his silence; for years the living forgot there was a quiet that needed guarding.\n\nWhen hands of greed reached their claws toward his peace, the mountain answered. Not with thunder or spear, but with a procession older than kings: the Immovables ‚Äî formations of living stone, walking ridges and shoulder-blades of earth, each a voice of the land‚Äôs long patience. They did not kill. They did not shout. They came like a remembering.\n\nThose who met them were not struck to death; they were offered a destiny: to become part of the world they had so desecrated. Flesh turned to root and root to granite; life‚Äôs hot, anxious rush cooled into a silence so deep it was mistaken for mercy. To the onlooker it was terror beyond measure‚Äîhow can a heart watch itself become the land? How can a man keep his name when his hands are soil? The continent learned a new fear that day: not of conquest, but of being remembered forever.\n\nThe Immovables receded when the world bowed; their footprints remained‚Äîvales of stone where laughter used to be. Poets would later call that day the Verdant Reckoning: a calamity that asks, once and forever, whether the living will learn to leave peace unplundered.",

    "description": "Under the shadow of a corrupted moon, the virtual reality game, \"The Paradise of Hell,\" ceased to be a fantasy. For Kaito, Misaki, and Yuji, along with their guild members, the massive announced update was a cruel trick. Trapped in the heart of a dungeon, reality dissolved, and the digital world merged with their flesh and bone.\n\nNow, they find themselves in a nightmarish realm where goblins and demonic beasts fly over ruined cities and curses are as real as the air they breathe. In this dark fantasy apocalypse, every encounter is a fight for survival. Healing potions have become bitter elixirs that barely stop the decay, and combat skills are all that stand between them and annihilation.\n\nAs time passes, desperation becomes the norm. While some give up, others fight to adapt, creating new rules and codes for survival. The world of \"The Paradise of Hell\" is a prison where the rules are rewritten with blood, and every death is a brutal lesson. Kaito, Misaki, and Yuji must navigate a brutal new reality to find a way to escape before this cursed paradise becomes their final resting place.",

Searching for purpose, Daylin stumbles upon something extraordinary hidden in the Carolina woods: a Karesh Core, a relic of an alien plot seeded on Earth millions of years ago.\n\nWhen the Core bonds with him, Daylin becomes part of a system designed to create ‚ÄúWarclades‚Äù‚Äîwarrior-societies who unite worlds through conflict and growth. Suddenly gifted with alien nanite technology, a living warship called Resh-1, and visions from long-dead Karesh commanders, he learns that humanity has unknowingly stepped onto a galactic stage. The Karesh will return to test Earth, and survival will only be possible if the planet can rise to the challenge.\n\nWith Aria and Chris soon drawn into his orbit, each gaining unique abilities through the Karesh system, Daylin begins to form humanity‚Äôs first Warclade. But governments take notice, suspicious of the alien technology and Chris‚Äôs desertion. The Pentagon struggles between fear and diplomacy, while other nations race to uncover the truth.\n\nAs Daylin and his team train within the Bastion, a colossal Karesh station hidden beyond Pluto, they discover the odds or more grim than they believed: even with years to prepare, Earth‚Äôs chance of survival is less than five percent. The fate of humanity hangs in the balance, dependent on whether Daylin can unify fractured governments and awaken a planet before the Karesh return.\n\nA tale of progression sci-fi fantasy, the story blends alien technology, personal transformation, and the clash of loyalty and destiny. At its heart, it follows one young man‚Äôs search for direction‚Äîfinding it in the most unusual way, as humanity‚Äôs reluctant Steward in a struggle older than the species itself.",

Eli, a steadfast cleric burdened by grief, seeks healing beyond his faith. Kida, a fierce dwarf mage-warrior, tests the boundaries of magic and steel. Rukh, a half-orc torn between primal instinct and druidic call, finds himself protecting more than just the wilds.

While it draws inspiration from real history, cultures, and ideas, everything here is fictional and should be read as a narrative, not as political doctrine. The names, systems, and events are used for storytelling and myth-building only.",

    "description": "The Sixth Kingdom: Land of the Mindless Beasts\n\nOnce a land of vibrant forests, fertile plains, and glittering rivers, the Sixth Kingdom was the region most devastated by the nuclear war. Unlike the other five kingdoms, where mutated humans and animals retained their intelligence, here the mutations spiraled out of control. The land itself is warped‚Äîforests twist into labyrinths of thorn, rivers run black with toxins, and mountains crumble into jagged spires.\n\nThe inhabitants are not rulers or citizens but monstrous abominations‚Äîanimals that lost all reason and descended into bloodthirsty instincts. These creatures are larger, stronger, and more unpredictable than their counterparts in the other kingdoms. They hunt anything that enters their territory, including one another, leaving behind only ruins and bones.\n\nAt the heart of this chaos lies the Gem of Eternity, a crystalline relic formed in the aftermath of the nuclear cataclysm. The gem radiates immense power, said to grant immortality and dominion over life itself. It is the source of both awe and terror‚Äîits corrupting influence believed to be the reason for the kingdom‚Äôs mindless mutations.\n\nNo ruler governs this land. Instead, the monsters themselves act as gatekeepers, ensuring only the strongest survive long enough to glimpse the gem‚Äôs glow. Over centuries, the Sixth Kingdom became a forbidden zone, a nightmare realm whispered of in the other lands.\n\nYet, it is also the greatest prize. Every war, every alliance, every betrayal across the five kingdoms circles back to the Sixth. For whoever claims the Gem of Eternity does not only gain unending life but also the power to rewrite the fate of the world.",

Their only escape? Historical reenactments and endless debates about battles long lost. But when a mysterious portal rips open on a rainy motorway, they‚Äôre hurled into a collapsing magi-tech feudal society where towering mechs rule the battlefield and power is measured in mana and steel.\n\nThe Triarch System is on the brink. Its ruling elite live aboard city-sized ships, each representing a fractured noble house. The capital world is a neon-lit hive of corruption, the breadbasket planet Galanthir groans under exploitation, and the mountainous forge-world churns out weapons for a war no one‚Äôs winning.

As they‚Äôre interrogated and conscripted, they must learn to survive in a world where magic meets machinery, and every choice could tip the balance of a dying empire.\n\nBut they weren‚Äôt born for this war. They weren‚Äôt trained for this world. They were just arguing about Jutland.\n\nAnd now, history is theirs to rewrite.",

She makes herself small: long runs, holding the line when pride wants a fight. Through a wedding, rumors, and a dangerous pregnancy, they learn the shape of each other‚Äôs silence, no long speeches, no fixing, just two people whom broken in their own ways. Under a cold moon they make their own rule: imprinting is a promise both choose. Renesmee is born; destiny steps aside. For readers who love steady heroines, protective men who listen, and romance like warmth in your heart, not fireworks. Canon remains; the difference is mercy, and a love strong enough to carry, not rescue.\n\nDisclaimer: I don‚Äôt own Twilight or its characters. All rights belong to Stephenie Meyer.

His stats are capped, his skills won‚Äôt level, and the system seems to exist solely to remind him he‚Äôs a disappointment.\n\nThen the gods drag him into their divine Arena and name him champion. Suddenly he‚Äôs surrounded by monsters, demigods, and killers twice his level. With nothing but sarcasm, bad luck, and a stubborn refusal to kneel. Each trial offers loot, skills, and power that could finally break his limits‚Ä¶ if the Arena doesn‚Äôt kill him first.\n\nVampire Lord is a witty, bloody LitRPG about a reluctant hero clawing his way up from failure. Expect brutal battles, evolving mechanics, and a vampire who hides his fear behind sharp fangs and sharper humor.",

After a brutal encounter leaves him wounded and unconscious, Shen falls into a hidden cavern beneath the mountains‚Äîwhere his blood awakens a long-forgotten power sealed within a mysterious stone.\n\nAs he sinks into the depths of a sacred pool, Shen relives the tragedy of his past: the death of his mother, Ling Xi, who sacrificed herself to protect his father, and the betrayal that shattered their family. From this pain, a dormant energy stirs within him‚Äîan inheritance tied to the sovereign lineage of the Ling clan.\n\nWhen Shen emerges from the pool, healed and marked by an ancient symbol, he is no longer the same. The forgotten blood of a sovereign flows through his veins, and with it, the power to reclaim his fate.\n\nBut in a world ruled by cultivation, betrayal, and legacy, awakening is only the beginning.",

All he has to do is charm a roomful of bankers, keep his cop nemesis off the doorstep, and marry off his daughter‚Äîmaybe both daughters. Instead, a black Ginza suitcase starts changing hands‚Äîunderwear, jewels, and cash trading places‚Äîwhile a priest rings the bell, a rival crew idles in the driveway, and an elocution professor accidentally becomes a fianc√©.\n\nAs Inspector Kenji T≈çmi circles with cameras, Kama‚Äôs mansion erupts into a champagne-soaked soap opera: a not-a-daughter who is, a lovesick accountant with a conscience, and a double wedding no one ordered. Every fix spawns three new disasters. By sunset, the only questions left are whether Kama lands a board seat or a mug shot‚Äîand whether love can outrun farce.\n\nFast, funny, and oddly tender, Yakuza Going Straight, Maybe? is a caper about family, face, and the impossible dream of going legit when everyone‚Äôs watching.\n\nP.S. Yes this is based off of the movie ‚ÄúOscar‚Äù if you haven't seen it it's worth watching.",
